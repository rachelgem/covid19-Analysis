 ## COVID-19 Influence Study

  At this point, I initiate the process of acquainting myself with the data. I gather insights about the dataset, identify areas requiring cleaning, address missing information, assess data organization, and confirm whether we possess the necessary information to address problem statement.

 ## Data Preparation

  - Ensured the data types are consistent.
  - Detect and removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
  - Filtered data from country column that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset.

## Visualization and Analysis

- The United States stands out with the highest traffic at 4,500 followed by Canada with 2,200. In contrast, Austraila and Chile had the lowest traffic volumes.
- October had the highest peak wih 52,000 followed by November at 51,000 and December experieced the lowest at 4,000.
- Quebec takes the top spot with 500, followed by California with 240, British Columbia at 200 and the Santiago province recorded the lowest traffic volume.
- Newark Liberty International, San Francisco International, Seatle Tacoma International, Toronto Pearson International, Vancouver International, Washington Dulles 
  International and Winniepeg International all share a high traffic volume each recording 268. In contrast, Santiago stands out with the lowest traffic volume with 238.

## Recommendation
- Considering the variation in airport traffic patterns due to COVID-19, it's advisable to tailor travel plans based on the current situation in each country. Prioritize destinations with lower traffic volumes, such as Australia and Chile, for potentially safer and less crowded travel experiences. Stay informed about travel restrictions and health guidelines in each location to make well-informed decisions.Prioritize locations with fewer reported cases for a more secure travel experience.
